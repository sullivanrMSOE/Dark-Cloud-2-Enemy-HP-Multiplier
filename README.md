# Dark-Cloud-2-Enemy-HP-Multiplier

This repository is the source code for the enemy HP multiplier mod for Dark Cloud (USA), emulated through PCSX2

To run the mod, build the project, run the resulting .exe as well as Dark Cloud 2 (USA) in PCSX2. Insert a valid, positive multiplier and press begin.
Enemies will have their health multiplied by whatever you inserted, allowing for potentially difficult or easier playthroughs.
